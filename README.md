Edventuorus OS

This is a mock-OS styled website showcasing not only the style of Edventure.ph but also the learnings I have attained during my time as an intern there. I've done so through a mutltiude of ways, from music and a scrapbook of sorts, to a notepad and about app explaining what an intern would take away from Edventure.ph if one ever decides to take up the opportunity.

With this I was able to improve my understanding of sveltekit and how each app works with each other through code with increased complexity.
